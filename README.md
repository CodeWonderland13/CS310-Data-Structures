# CS310 Data Structures

This repository contains the implementation of data structures and algorithms as part of my **CS 310 Data Structures** course. It includes various assignments and projects demonstrating the use of different data structures like linked lists, binary trees, heaps, and more, along with algorithm implementations such as sorting and searching techniques.

## This repository helped me:
- **Understand and implement fundamental data structures.**
- **Analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms.**
- **Solve real-world problems using appropriate data structures and algorithms.**
- **Gain hands-on experience with Java programming in the context of computational problem-solving.**

## Features

### 1. **Linked Lists**: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
- **Assignment 1**
- **Assignment 4**

### 2. **Object-oriented structure and inheritance**
- **Assignment 2**

### 3. **Array Lists**
- **Assignment 3**
- **Assignment 4**

### 4. **Hashmaps/PriorityQueue/Array**
- **Assignment 4**

### 5. **Stacks and Queues**: Implemented using arrays and linked lists.
- **Assignment 7**
- **Assignment 8**

### 6. **Binary Trees**: Including binary search trees, AVL trees, and traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- **Assignment 6**
