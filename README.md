# CS310-Data-Structures
This repository contains the implementation of data structures and algorithms as part of my CS 310 Data Structures course. It includes various assignments and projects demonstrating the use of different data structures like linked lists, binary trees, heaps, and more, along with algorithm implementations such as sorting and searching techniques.

This repository helped me:

Understand and implement fundamental data structures.
Analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms.
Solve real-world problems using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
Gain hands-on experience with Java programming in the context of computational problem-solving.

Features

 1. Linked Lists: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
 
 2. Object-oriented structure and inheritance

3. Stacks and Queues: Implemented using arrays and linked lists.
  
4. Binary Trees: Including binary search trees, AVL trees, and traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
5. Heaps: Max-heaps and min-heaps, along with heapsort implementation.
